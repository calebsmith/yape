This project was once taken from reusable parts of the razzytails game. It has largely been abandoned. However, it could still be used as a starting point for making games with Pygame.

Yet Another Pygame Engine - A game engine for tile-based 2D games


To make the pygame PyPi package compile on a debian system:
    sudo apt-get install libv4l-dev
    sudo ln -s /usr/include/libv4l1-videodev.h /usr/include/linux/videodev.h
